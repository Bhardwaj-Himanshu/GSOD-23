**Project Description**
=====================
- Name: [Reorganize the contributor guide](https://github.com/WasmEdge/GSoD2023#project-idea-reorganize-the-contributor-guide)
- Mentor:  @yiying , @juntao, @alabulei1
- About it:
  - **What is it?**: WasmEdge provides a flexible plug-in architecture that allows developers to add more functionalities to it and take advantage of its many integrations and distribution channels through extensive open source partnerships. A plug-in could package and register native host functions in the WasmEdge runtime. The Wasm bytecode program could then call those native host functions.
  - **Goal**: However, the absence of comprehensive tutorials and reference documentation can be challenging for community members who want to contribute new plug-ins. By providing well-structured documentation, the process of developing plug-ins becomes more straightforward and accessible.
 


**About me**
=====================
My major programming language was C++ until I started procastinating on which on is the best? Switched to python then for a change and reliased language is just a medium and what I was fearing was fearing was uncomfortness of doing things and implementing them.

I have **do have a little open source experience as of now**. But I do want to want to contribute to open source and GSOD felt great! About how experienced am I with 

- Writing Markdown files([Example-1](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/GSOC_SUBMISSION_2023/blob/main/README.md), [Example-2](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/GSOC_SUBMISSION_2023/blob/main/Internet%20Health%20Report/PROPOSAL.MD), [Example-3](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/blob/main/README.md))
- Successfully pushed into a [INSTALL.MD](https://github.com/google/gcp_scanner/blob/main/INSTALL.md) file for an organisation([gcp_scanner](https://github.com/google/gcp_scanner/pull/131))

**Homework**
=====================
- Created a Tutorial for WasmEdge using docusaurus which is [deployed_here](https://bhardwaj-himanshu.github.io/my-wasmu-website/).
  - working on integrating CI/CD pipelines now in it. 
- Getting my hands on the codebase.
- Getting familiar with the WasmEdge as a whole and figuring out how it works.

**Plan**
=====================


 - ## How Documenting helps?
 
 
 1. **Facilitating Collaboration**:Documenting a codebase can help multiple developers to work on the same codebase without any conflicts. *Documenting the codebase can help developers to understand each other's code and collaborate more effectively.*
    
2.  **Easing Maintenance**: Documenting a codebase can make it easier to maintain the code. It helps to keep track of what different parts of the code do and how they are connected. *This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs, add new features, or make changes to the code in the future.*
    
3.  **Onboarding New Developers**: Documenting a codebase can also help onboard new developers to the team or project. *When new developers join a project, they can quickly get up to speed on the codebase by referring to the documentation.*    

4.  **Knowledge Transfer**: *Documenting a codebase is also an effective way to transfer knowledge from one developer to another. When a developer leaves a project, they can leave behind documentation that will help their successor understand the codebase.*
    
5.  **Improving Code Quality**: *When developers document their code, they tend to write cleaner, more organized code that is easier to understand and maintain. This can help prevent bugs and make the code more scalable.* 
    
- ## Steps
- Writing the content
               - Yes, this just involves writing the content but let's see how are we going to achieve that, "cause it's easier said than done".
### Architectural Overview


     This could probably include the architecutres the program uses behind the curtains for installation.
With some flowcharts on explainations of the systems linking and acting together.

### Getting started with contributing

add screenshot of there contributions page

â€¢ Contributing guidance can start with either providing installation tasks and then how to set it up, with addition of some code snippets like-
```py
#write your first hello world, after setting up the environment
Or
print("Hello World")
```
```yml
service:"3"
connect to ports 8080:8080
```
Like as mentioned above,which would be very helpful for new users to setup the environment.

### Building WasmEdge   
Details on how to build things in WasmEdge and `how` to `start` doing things.
Figuring `out` what to do and how `to-do`.

and so on and so forth for every document.
          

More on these in detail below in  ~~Detailed Steps~~.


**Timeline**
=====================

## Official Overview

- **March 31**: Accepted GSoD organisations announced;
- **March 31--**: Document development begins
- **May 10**: Deadline to hire technical Writer
- **July - August**: Work Period | GSoD contributors work on their project with guidance from Mentors;
- **September--**: Final Week.

## Detailed Steps

- **Till May 10**
  - Publish and write basic demos for the documentation files.

- **May 10- May 20**
  - Start contacting the plug-in teams as well as well as code team to apply the code snippets wherever required.

- **May 20- June 20**
  - Getting the documents evaluated by the mentors as well as from the organisation.
  - Adding more features, images as well as block diagrams to make it interactive

- **June-July-August**
    - Time to add the last bit touches, as well as I hope new development things get over till, so as to create documents for them as well.

  
**Why me**
=====================
I like working on various *operating systems/code-bases/tech* and just get intrigued by the way things work and have been working, if anything breaks I like that too, joking! But yep they do definately provide a remembering experience.

I love digging into things and also curious about what makes a thing stand out but at the same time user-scalable i.e speaking to the masses, where these documents and this technology comes into play, the just idea of spreading knowledge and helping others to enhance there knowledge as well.

Coming onto Open-Source, as being just a admirer of how people provide things and help other with same interests to contribute onto the thing is just amazing, a pure soul maybe!  Always been a admirer and now want to become a user/contributor to this space as well.


I have created a [Github-Repo](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/Wasm_Edge_GSOD-23) for my this year's submissions, if you want to check out.
Also, try to look for a easter egg question in my [PROPOSAL.MD](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/GSOD_2023/blob/main/WasmEdge/PROPOSAL.MD).
