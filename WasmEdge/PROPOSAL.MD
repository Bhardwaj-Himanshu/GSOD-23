**Project Description**
=====================
- Name: [Reorganize the contributor guide, plug-ins Guide](https://github.com/WasmEdge/GSoD2023#project-idea-reorganize-the-contributor-guide)
- Mentor:  @yiying , @juntao, @alabulei1
- About it:
  - **What is it?**: WasmEdge provides a flexible plug-in architecture that allows developers to add more functionalities to it and take advantage of its many integrations and distribution channels through extensive open source partnerships. A plug-in could package and register native host functions in the WasmEdge runtime. The Wasm bytecode program could then call those native host functions.
  - **Goal**: However, the absence of comprehensive tutorials and reference documentation can be challenging for community members who want to contribute new plug-ins. By providing well-structured documentation, the process of developing plug-ins becomes more straightforward and accessible.
 


**About me**
=====================
My major programming language was C++ until I started procastinating on which on is the best? Switched to python then for a change and reliased language is just a medium and what I was fearing was fearing was uncomfortness of doing things and implementing them.

I have **do have a little open source experience as of now**. But I do want to want to contribute to open source and GSOD felt great! About how experienced am I with 

- Writing Markdown files([Example-1](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/GSOC_SUBMISSION_2023/blob/main/README.md), [Example-2](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/GSOC_SUBMISSION_2023/blob/main/Internet%20Health%20Report/PROPOSAL.MD), [Example-3](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/blob/main/README.md))
- Successfully pushed into a [INSTALL.MD](https://github.com/google/gcp_scanner/blob/main/INSTALL.md) file for an organisation([gcp_scanner](https://github.com/google/gcp_scanner/pull/131))

**Plan**
=====================
## How I look at it?
 
 1.  **Easier onboarding New Developers**: Documenting a codebase is only effective if it is easily understandable by a new contributor, *making use of interactive gif's, videos and jotting down bigger steps into smaller ones help*, the person to work at his/her pace with little stress levels of breaking anything .*    

2.  **Knowledge Transfer**: *Documenting a codebase is also an effective way to transfer knowledge from one developer to another. When a developer leaves a project, they can leave behind documentation that will help their successor understand the codebase.*
    
3.  **Improving Code Quality**: *When developers document their code, they tend to write cleaner, more organized code that is easier to understand and maintain. This can help prevent bugs and make the code more scalable.* 
    
## **Steps**
- Writing the content
               - Yes, this just involves writing the content but let's see how we are going to achieve that, "cause it's easier said than done".

### Guide for Plugins

Plug-ins play a very major role, keeping the major role in mind--> errors while writing plug-in code should be avoided and hence, I would a major chunk of time learning about the building as well usage of plug-ins before making a contribution guide for it.

This would give maximum time to reconsider changes as well as fix some bugs, until they are implemented over the website.
Don't worry a basic structures of 
   - how they work?
   - what are they?
   - what all technologies are involved?
   - how to use them?
Would be plotted down and the code syntax would only be left for filling.  


### Guide for Regular Contribution

Meanwhile the plug-in code is being published and checked, I can continuously work on restructuring and reorganizing the other documents, which are the basic working and do not require any major change.

This would give us both time for plug-in as well as won't stop the writing work.



### Other Pages like architectural overview and internal structure/working   

These are the pages which either can be added separately or within a single document, what matters is the User is able to find out what to look for and how to use it.




**Timeline**
=====================

## Official Overview

- **March 31**: Accepted GSoD organizations announced;
- **April 28**: Deadline to hire technical Writer
- **June-July**: Work Period | GSoD contributors work on their project with guidance from Mentors;
- **August--**: Final Week.

## Detailed Steps
  
| Week | Working on | Details 
| ----------- | ----------- |  ---------|
| Week 1 | Basic syntax for both plug-in,contributor guide; | Basic syntax of both completed
| Week 2 | Implementing Code Snippets, after testing | Code snippets and other links successfully verified
| Week 3 | Testing/Edits/Changes | on suggestions by community
| Week 4 | Plugin and contributor guides--completed! | Buffer time.
| Week 5 |Final test+deploy | Checking working links and website.


  
**Why me**
=====================
I like working on various *operating systems/code-bases/tech* and just get intrigued by the way things work and have been working, if anything breaks I like that too, joking! But yep they do definately provide a remembering experience.

I love digging into things and also curious about what makes a thing stand out but at the same time user-scalable i.e speaking to the masses, where these documents and this technology comes into play, the just idea of spreading knowledge and helping others to enhance there knowledge as well.

Coming onto Open-Source, as being just a admirer of how people provide things and help other with same interests to contribute onto the thing is just amazing, a pure soul maybe!  Always been a admirer and now want to become a user/contributor to this space as well.


I have created a [Github-Repo](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/Wasm_Edge_GSOD-23) for my this year's submissions, if you want to check out.
Also, try to look for a easter egg question in my [PROPOSAL.MD](https://github.com/Bhardwaj-Himanshu/GSOD_2023/blob/main/WasmEdge/PROPOSAL.MD).

## Side Work/Spare Time Work
### Created a  WasmEdge Tutorial Website made using docusaurus [Link](https://bhardwaj-himanshu.github.io/my-wasmu-website/), [Youtube_Video_Tutorial](https://youtu.be/nMnjvONvo1s)
### Created a Developing Plugins small section/guide using retype [Link](https://retype-wasmedge-himanshu-bhardwaj.netlify.app/)

### Bucket-list achieved with docusaurus one
- These are the things that have been done with the website.
   - [x] Made a cool looking demo
   - [x] Need to host the website
   - [x] Figure out how to change default images
   - [x] Changing the color-scheme to fit
   - [x] Adding accurate and new content to the guide
   - [x] Integrating CI/CD pipelines
   - [x] Make tutorial videos with voice and publish on youtube
     - [x] Record the video
     - [x] Record the audio

### Bucket-list achieved with retype one
- These are the things that have been done with the website.
   - [x] Similar things as above
   - [x] Hosted the website
   - [x] CI/CD using gh-pages
   - [ ] Not able to achieve CI/CD pipeline using netlify--working on this<--
